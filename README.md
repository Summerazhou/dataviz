### Data Visualization with R

#### [David Sasson](http://davidsasson.info/)

Learn how to manipulate complex datasets with ggplot2—a popular and aesthetically pleasing graphics framework in R. Topics covered include aesthetic mapping and scales, faceting, and themes. After a brief tutorial of basics, we’ll perform some data exploration and visualization of the MIMIC database. Some familiarity with R would be useful for this workshop, although it is not required. Participants should have a working copy of R, RStudio, and MIMIC downloaded on their computer.
