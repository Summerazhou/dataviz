We're going to create [this graphic](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2011/12/02/corrosive-corruption), with only a few lines of code. 

![](http://tutorials-live.iq.harvard.edu:8000/user/VEAvyv9hyOLR/notebooks/workshops/R/Rgraphics/images/Economist1.png)


```{r}
dat <- read.csv("EconomistData.csv")

pc1 <- ggplot(dat, aes(x = CPI, y = HDI, color = Region))
pc1 + geom_point()
```


To complete this graph we need to:

* add a trend line
* change the point shape to open circle
* change the order and labels of Region
* label select points
* fix up the tick marks and labels
* move color legend to the top
* title, label axes, remove legend title
* theme the graph with no vertical guides
* add model R2 (hard)
* add sources note (hard)
* final touches to make it perfect (use image editor for this)
